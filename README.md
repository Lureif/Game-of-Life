# Game-of-Life
yet another implementation of conway's game of life.\
This version uses SDL2 to render the field.\
Minimalism was in mind, hence the absence of an\
on-screen menu.

## Controls
f: faster\
s: slower\
i: iterate\
p: pause\
r: randomize\
1: change population density to LOW\
2: change population density to MEDIUM\
3: change population density to HIGH\
ESC: Exit program

(1, 2 and 3 will take effect after hitting r)

## Dependencies
Just sdl2.

## Compiling
make -> compile executable (./game_of_life)\
make clean -> delete obj files\
make fclean -> dekete obj files + executable

## Bugs
Sometimes some cells don't render properly.\
they're there, just invisible. I'm not too sure why yet.
